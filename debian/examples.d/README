txt2man
-------

EXAMPLE OF USAGE

The following command will generate a manpage from txt2man.txt file, used
as source code:

    $ txt2man -d "15 May 2016" -t txt2man -r txt2man-1.5.6 -s 1 -v "converts text to man page" txt2man.txt > txt2man.1

Alternatively, you can use the create-man.sh script, available in the same
directory of this README file. All you need is change the variables value
and run the script. You can run the current configured script to see an
example over START-HERE.TXT text.

Note that a manpage name must be written in lower case. START-HERE.TXT and
START-HERE-2.TXT are in upper case to draw attention of users.

To see a manpage locally, you can use 'man -l' command or './' in manpage
name. You also can use the full path of manpage. See some examples below:

    $ man -l start-here.1
    $ man ./start-here.1
    $ man /usr/share/doc/txt2man/examples/start-here.1
